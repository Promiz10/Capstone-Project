# IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project
## Project Overview
In this project I  have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for programming skills for this year's report on emerging skills. The first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:
<ul>
  <li>Job postings</li>
  <li>Training portals</li>
  <li>Surveys</li>
</ul>
After collecting enough data, analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:
<ul>
  <li>What are the top programming languages in demand?</li>
  <li>What are the top database skills in demand?</li>
  <li>What are the popular IDEs?</li>
</ul>
Then bring all of the information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard
