# IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project
## Project Overview
In this project I  have been tasked with collecting data from various sources to identifying trends for programming skills for this year's and emerging programming skills. The first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:
<ul>
  <li>Training portal</li>
  <li>Surveys</li>
</ul>
After collecting enough data, analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:
<ul>
  <li>What are the top programming languages in demand?</li>
  <li>What are the top database skills in demand?</li>
  <li>What are the popular WebFrames?</li>
</ul>
Then bring all of the information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard

## Data Sources

## Conclusion
A dashboard was created using Cognos Analytics top show the top languages, emerging languages and the respondent demographic from the survey data.
The dashboard can be viewed below, click on the link to interact with the dashboard.
